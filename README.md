## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation
First step is to open github and create a new repository for Challenge 4 (Give the repo a unique name to help differ it from other projects), Open the files folder and open the newly made repo, There should be nothing but the read.me. Search the files for the UCB bootcamp file (in the same page or new one). The starter code should now be in the folder and be accessible. If no starter code you must create the code from scratch. Create a page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to display a functional quiz.
